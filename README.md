# Data-Structures

This program takes a csv file of a country's name, capitol, population, Covid cases, Covid deaths, and area in a country object. 
It then adds each country object to an array of type country. 
It then asks the user how they want to sort the country, and outputs the countries to the user using either bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort. 
Also asks if they would like to search for a country, and then uses either binary search or equential search depending on if the countries have been sorted by name or not.
